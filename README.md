## Description

This is an application built with [React](https://react.dev/), and bootstrapped with
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It is a build that displays the

## General Information

This project is a rebuild of a project that was originally
created during my time in the July 2022 cohort
at Alchemy Code Lab, in Portland, Oregon.

## Authors

> [@Adam-Robson](https://www.github.com/Adam-Robson)

## Features

An exercise for beginners learning React, to begin working with component architecture,
and a declarative approach to creating the User Interface.

## Objectives

1. Use `className` attribute to set styles versus the `style` attribute
2. Display images in React
3. Use attributes in parent components to pass data down to child components as props
4. Use {} as “portals” in the render method to write JavaScript inside HTML (JSX)
5. Use `.map()` to iterate over an array and render new elements for each item in an array
6. Add a unique key to each element rendered
7. Use Netlify to deploy React app

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- JSX
- CSS
- React
- ESLint
- Prettier
- GitHub Actions
- Netlify

## Run Locally

The following steps will run the app in the _development_ mode:

1. Clone the project: `$ git clone https://the-project`

2. Go to the project directory: `$ cd the-project`

3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

4. Start the server: `npm run dev`

5. Open `http://localhost:5173` to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits,
and any lint errors will appear in the console.
